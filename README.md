Polaris 2018
=============
Creating a scaffolding for full stack [React](https://reactjs.org) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) (striving to put everything in TS), [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org), [Jest](https://jestjs.io), [Express](https://expressjs.com), [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) and make them all work cohesively

### Vision
This is a work in progress. Idea is to treat this as scaffolding for future projects.
It will also be a learning of all these technologies in React Ecosystem.

### Technologies to be incorporated
* [React 16.3](https://reactjs.org)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) (Both on client and server side)
* [React Router 4](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)
* [PostCSS](https://postcss.org) for CSS
* [Webpack 4](https://webpack.js.org)
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io) (React Testing)
* [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com)
* [GraphQL](https://graphql.org)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com) 
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)
* Testing for Express (not sure which framework to use)
