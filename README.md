Polaris 2018
=============
Creating a scaffolding for full stack React with TypeScript (striving to put everything in TS), Apollo, GraphQL, Jest, Express, React Router and make them all work cohesively

### Vision
This is a work in progress. Idea is to treat this as scaffolding for future projects.
It will also be a learning of all these technologies in React Ecosystem.

### Technologies to be incorporated
* [React 16.3](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html) (Both on client and server side)
* [React Router 4](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/native/guides/philosophy)
* [PostCSS](http://api.postcss.org/) for CSS
* [Webpack 4](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/)
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/api) (React Testing)
* [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/)
* [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html)
* [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/)
* Testing for Express (not sure which framework to use)
